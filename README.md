# Projects
Hello, I'm Megan Chen. I have participated in a number of different projects. Each demonstrate a different aspect of the technical skills I have such as coding, prototyping on an FPGA, etc. More detailed information about projects I have worked on have been linked in this repository. 

[Hazel Website](https://github.com/meganc46/Projects/blob/main/README-Hazel.md): A website for an app that teaches users about climate change and helps them offset their carbon footprint.
Uses: Flutter/Dart, Figma

[Fake News Detector](https://github.com/gt-big-data/fake-news): Using machine learning to detect fake news within articles.
Uses: Python, Jupyter Notebook

[Stock Prediction](https://github.com/meganc46/Projects/blob/main/README-Stocks.md): Stock prediction model using sentiment analysis from social media and stock metrics.
Used: Python (NumPy, Pandas, Sci-kit Learn, etc.), Jupyter Notebook 

[Security System Simulator](https://github.com/meganc46/Projects/blob/main/README-Security.md): Devices created in Quartus and tested on a DE-10 Lite FPGA. A security system simulator app demonstrates the functionality of the two devices.
Used: VHDL, SCOMP (Assembly), Quartus

# Design Projects
I also have have experience designing products and UI. Here are some sample projects.

[Hazel Website](https://www.figma.com/proto/oGZWVaj6wMqHDvjR9w4h3c/Team-1330-Initial-Prototype?node-id=4%3A3&scaling=scale-down&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=4%3A3): UI prototype made for the Hazel website. 

[DAISY '20](https://github.com/meganc46/Projects/blob/main/daisy20-poster.PNG): DAISY '20 is a home decor brand taking inspiration from the Art Deco movement. The displayed product is a clock imitates the lavishness of the 1920's Art Deco style.

[Orbit](https://github.com/meganc46/Projects/blob/main/README-Design.md#orbit): Orbit is the name of a oil and vinegar container set that explores applications of the 1:1 proportional system in its product design.

[GhostRed Website](https://www.figma.com/proto/lNSYe4n8MXU4iFJItb4X0v/GhostRed?node-id=2%3A2&scaling=scale-down&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=2%3A2): UI prototype made for the GE GhostRed ctf problem crowdsourcing site. All assets on this draft were created by me.
